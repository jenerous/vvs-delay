# vvs-delay-dataset

VVS is a public transport organization located in and around Stuttgart, Germany.
We are trying to create a dataset which contains data about delays that appeared
over time.

Furthermore a neural network shall be trained to predict delays.
Therefore we use an convolutional approach since spatial relations should have impact to delay
## Input example
we reduced the transportation network to an pixel image where each pixel corrosponds to one station at most
